Information retrieval is the foundation of every modern search engine. The goal of an IR system is to efficiently locate 
relevant information from large document collections. Classic IR concepts such as inverted indexes, term frequency, 
inverse document frequency, and ranking models form the backbone of search platforms used worldwide.

An inverted index allows search engines to map each token or term to the list of documents in which it appears. This 
structure enables fast lookups and dramatically reduces the amount of work required during querying. Ranking algorithms 
such as TF-IDF score documents based on how important a word is within a particular document and how rare it is across 
the entire collection.

Search engines further enhance relevance with techniques like stemming, stopword removal, phrase queries, and proximity 
search. More advanced systems use models like BM25 or transformer-based embeddings to understand semantic meaning instead 
of relying only on raw keyword matching. As data volumes grow, distributed indexing, cache layers, and replication become 
critical to ensure high-performance search under heavy load.
