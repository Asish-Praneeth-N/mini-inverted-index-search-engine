Modern distributed systems are designed to handle massive amounts of data and millions of user requests per second. 
Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta rely on these large-scale architectures to power search engines, cloud platforms, 
streaming services, and real-time communication tools. A distributed system typically runs across multiple machines, 
often spanning different regions or availability zones, and is designed with principles such as replication, fault 
tolerance, load balancing, and horizontal scalability.

One of the key challenges in distributed computing is maintaining consistency while achieving high availability. 
Techniques like sharding, consensus algorithms (such as Paxos and Raft), and distributed hash tables help coordinate 
updates across nodes. Engineers must also consider system latency, network failures, and data partitioning when designing 
high-performance backend services.

Search engines, in particular, depend heavily on distributed indexing and retrieval algorithms. Processing billions of 
documents requires parallel indexing pipelines, optimized storage layers, and query-serving systems that can return 
relevant results within milliseconds. These systems combine information retrieval techniques with distributed processing 
to ensure scalability and accuracy.
