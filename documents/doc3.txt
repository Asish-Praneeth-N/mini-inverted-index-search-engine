Cloud computing has transformed how organizations build and deploy software. Instead of managing physical servers, 
developers now rely on scalable cloud infrastructures that provide compute power, storage, networking, and managed 
services on demand. Platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure allow teams to build reliable systems that automatically 
scale based on traffic patterns or resource usage.

A key aspect of cloud architecture is the ability to design systems that remain reliable even under high load or 
component failures. Concepts such as auto-scaling, health checks, distributed caches, and message queues play a crucial 
role in maintaining stability. Engineers must consider network topology, latency between services, and efficient resource 
allocation when designing cloud-native systems.

Scalability is achieved through horizontal scaling, container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and microservice-based 
architectures. Each service is designed to be loosely coupled, independently deployable, and resilient to failures. Logs, 
metrics, and tracing systems help monitor system performance and detect bottlenecks. Combined with strong foundations in 
algorithms and systems design, cloud computing enables teams to build applications that handle millions of users reliably.
